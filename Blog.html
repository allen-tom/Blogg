						<h2>Was the decision of James Madison to got to war with Britian the right thing to do for America? </h2>

						<p> The War of 1812 was a war that was not necessary for the evolution of America. Even though America was annoyed by the British ships bombarding and destroying American ships, if they had faced this problem with peaceful terms, they could have avoided the war. The impatient march into war was backfiring on the Americans at first. The overpowering British navy was breezing thorugh the American defenses and they even got to level of invading that led to the inevitable burning of Washington D.C. and the White House. America was lucky to win the war because British had other wars with other European nations at the same time. The Battle of New Orleans led Andrew Jackson to Presidency.</p>

					<p>I belive the decison of James Madison was the right decision because the war had led to two things. One being that it led the nation to a new spirit of nationalism; and the second is that it led to the Presidencial election of Andrew Jackson that led to the increased power of the Democrats from the South and the West.</p>

					<p>I also agree that James Madison decision to war was the incorrect decision because war causes individuals to greater power and it also gives more importance to the American military; which causes America to appear as a nation to fear and acknowledge.</p>

					<p>I agree with the author of this article because the War of 1812, also known as "Madison's War" was a war that was won by luck; because if Britian had only been fighting America rather than the entire world, the American military during that time would have been crushed.</p>
